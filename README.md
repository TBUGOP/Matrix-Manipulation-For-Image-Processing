# Matrix-Manipulation-for-Image-Processing
Matrix Manipulation for Image Processing using Python (OpenCV, Matplotlib and NumPy). 
This is done with the help of concepts of Linear Algebra and Computational Programs. 
Here I have worked on three functionalities: 
1. Generating images with Matrix 
2. Applying operation on Matrix to flip the image  
3. Multiplying various Kernels to matrix for blurring the image
